This is a simple react web app aimed to generate random quotes by fetching it from the "https://ron-swanson-quotes.herokuapp.com/v2/quotes" api.
The web app used simple hookes to render the components and keeping it true to react fundamentals.
Made as a task by the "TheGoodGame Theory" react internship assessment.
